        I'm Christianah Akingbehin, born and brought up in the 'State of Excellence'; Lagos, Nigeria, so you best believe I was raised to strive for 'Excellence'. 
                I'm a senior at Ben Davis High School currently and I plan to become a surgeon, in case you can't tell from my creepy OR backgrounds <i class="fas far fa-laugh"></i>
