        <h1>Hey Cutie!</h1>
        <p>I'm Christy, I just got interested in web design, if you're a beginner like me, my advice is to keep tryng to be better no matter what.
            <strong>WEB DESIGN</strong>made me realize that there's nothing I set my mind to do that is impossible.
            Aside from web design, Whatever you want to become, always strive to be better. Never settle for <div class= "Mediocre">Mediocrity!</div>
            Walking a mile starts from one step, as well as reaching your dream.</p>
